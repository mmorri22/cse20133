    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to give you some more practice writing functions, using separate compilation, and Makefiles. Furthermore, this assignment will strengthen your ability to use arrays, pass arrays to functions, and sorting an array of values. It will also test your ability to use top-down design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common means that can be associated with a group of values. You should already be familiar with the <b>arithmetic mean</b>, a.k.a. the average. The arithmetic mean is calculated by dividing the sum of all the values by the number of values, where each val is an individual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "arithmetic= \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}val_{i}}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, if we have 6 values of 3.2, 4.3, 1.7, 7.7, 5.2, and 8.1, the arithmetic mean would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "geometric= \\frac{{3.2+4.3+1.7+7.7+5.2+8.1}}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second mean we'll work with is the <b>geometric mean</b>. It is calculated by taking the nth root of the product of all the values. The geometric mean is useful as a measure of central tendency, because it is less affected by extreme values than is the arithmetic mean. We find the geometric mean by multiplying all the values and then taking the nth-root, where n is the number of values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "gemetric= \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}val_{i}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have 6 values of 3.2, 4.3, 1.7, 7.7, 5.2, and 8.1, the geometric mean would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "geometric= \\sqrt[6]{3.2*4.3*1.7*7.7*5.2*8.1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last mean is known as the <b>harmonic mean</b>. The harmonic mean is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals. The harmonic mean is given by the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "harmonic=\\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{val_{i}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have 6 values of 3.2, 4.3, 1.7, 7.7, 5.2, and 8.1, the harmonic mean would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "harmonic=\\frac{6}{\\frac{1}{3.2}+\\frac{1}{4.3}+\\frac{1}{1.7}+\\frac{1}{7.7}+\\frac{1}{5.2}+\\frac{1}{8.1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to write a program that calculates each of the three means and prints them to the user. The values will be positive doubles\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculation of the geometric mean involves the taking of the nth root of the product of the values, you will need to use the <code>pow()</code> function found in the math library, which we will describe later.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><code>#include < math.h ><code></li>\n",
    "    <li>Use the <code>-lm</code> compiler flag ( Lowercase l, not the number 1. It means \"link math\")</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.</b> Open Docker Desktop. Go to the cse20133-user Container you created. Press the Blue Triangle to start the Container.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.</b> Open VSCode, and on the left, select the blue button in the bottom left of VSCode. At the top, select the pull-down choice “Attach to running container” and select your CSE 20133 course container.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3.</b> Go into your Git Folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Recall that @USERNAME is the unique username you created when you created your GitHub account. You will see your user name in the VS Code Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd cse20133-user/cse20133-@USERNAME\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir homework3\n",
    "    cd homework3\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - You must use separate compilation and must name your four files:\n",
    "\n",
    "    homework03.c, means.c, means.h, and Makefile\n",
    "    \n",
    "5 - The maximum number of values the user can read in is 25 and all of the values should be read in as doubles. If the user enters <code>-1</code>, that should be regarded as a sentinel and is NOT to be considered one of the values in the set.\n",
    "        \n",
    "><b>Hint:</b> You may recall that we should not use <code>doubles</code> in <code>if</code> comparisons since they are precise and not accurate. So in order to make this work, simply check for the value being <b>less than 0</b>. Since the value of 0 in a double is accurate (meaning exactly 0), any value below 0 - <i>including -1</i> will cause the loop to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - You should keep modularity in mind and design functions so that they can be reused with other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>A good rule:</b> If you can break it down into multiple functions, you should do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Another good rule</b>: Unless you absolutely have to, you should only have function calls and defined variables in main. You will not need to break this rule in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 - You must have a function called FillArray() that fills the array with the data that is being read from the user input and returns the number of values entered by the user. FillArray() must have the following prototype:\n",
    "\n",
    "    void FillArray(double array[], unsigned int* maxSize);\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned value should be the number of values the user entered (with the exception of -1.00)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8 - Be sure to use the Production Quality Compilation rules and make your own Makefile. The TAs will use the command <code>make homework03</code> to run your program\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    make homework03\n",
    "    gcc -std=c2x -O2 -g -Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -Wshadow -Werror -lm -c homework03.c\n",
