    "### Submission Part 1 - The Explanatory Article\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first major deliverable is an explanatory article on your topic. The goal of this article is to guide a reader on a journey from ignorance to understanding. This means that you’ll want to explain your concepts using a mix of high-level intuitions, drawings, animations, and interactive demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as more of an exercise in good storytelling rather than an exercise in writing a journal article. Journal articles are designed to be compact. There’s an expectation that someone reading a paper will sit down with scratch paper and take notes, following along with the reasoning and pausing to verify intermediate results if necessary. In that sense, a journal article can be thought of as “knowledge concentrate” – you need to add some water and stir quite a bit to get something edible out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, what I’m asking you to do is to write something that is lucid, clear, well-motivated, and easy to follow. Be conversational. Draw lots of pictures. Provide motivation for the topic and each piece. Give intuitive explanations before going into more difficult math. Create some animations showing how things work, or give the user interactive controls they can use to step through things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "You may come up with creative ways to perform this Explanatory Article, but it must include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <b>Group Members</b> - 25 points will be for every group member to include their name and netIDs for ease of entering grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) <b>Location of Code</b> - Another 25 points will include an indication of which group member pushed the code to GitHub. Only one group member is required to push as long as it is properly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) <b>The Topic Being Visualized</b> - In your own words will describe the concept you are going to visualize. Your description must inlude a high-level technical description of the topic, and the challenges with conventional approachs to visualizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) <b>Your Approach</b> - You must describe in detail the approach to reading in and storing data (the C++ class itself), how you are processing the data, and your approach to producing the visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "5) <b>Description of the output</b> - You should desribe how to run your code (how someone who has your code will replicate your results), as well a description of the what the visual is telling us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of the Explanatory Article\n",
    "\n",
    "Your explanatory article will be evaluated on the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Clarity</b>: How clear is your exposition on the topic? Does it flow naturally in a way that guides the reader through a difficult idea, or does it force the reader to keep pausing to refer back to concepts that are described earlier? Does it contain speling, grammatically, or fᵒʳ mₐTt iⁿg errors, or is it well-proofread? Remember that your goal isn’t to just brain-dump everything you’ve learned; it’s to explain how something works and why it’s worth learning about in the first place.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Intuition</b>: How well does your write-up communicate the intuition behind your topic? For example, if there’s some key technical lemma necessary for things to work properly, did you just present the concept “as-is,” or did you help the reader contextualize what it says and understand why it’s true? If there’s some unusual choice of a constant, can you account for why that constant is chosen that way? And if there’s something that’s surprising, can you provide an explanation as to why, in retrospect, it might not be as surprising as initially perceived?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Rigor</b>: This is an engineering class, after all, and so we will be looking at how rigorous you are in your write up. You don’t need to prove everything, but you shouldn’t hand-wave away every result. Pick a few interesting bits here and there and really dive deep into them! This is something that, hopefully, you’ll already have done when reading up on the topic in the first place.\n",

    "    <li><a href = \"https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/\">Making Maps with Noise Functions</a> by Amit Patel. This article explores noise functions and how to use them to generate realistic terrains. The interactive slides make this a joy to explore and provide a powerful intuition for how everything fits together.</li>\n",
    "    <li><a href = \"https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ewcg06/invited/Seidel.pdf\">Understanding the Inverse Ackermann Function</a> by Raimund Seidel. This talk, which was given by a computer scientist who published a new analysis of the union-find data structure, does a great job motivating both the result that he proved and explaining what on earth the Ackermann inverse function actually is. It blends technical rigor with a conversational tone and good use of diagrams.</li>\n",
    "    <li><a href = \"https://ncase.me/trust/\">The Evolution of Trust</a> by Nicky Case. This interactive exploration of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma gives an intuitive feel for the game and the different strategies involved, and in doing so surveys the literature in a deep but approachable way. Is this an “article” in the conventional sense? Nope! But would I be okay with you submitting something like this? Oh yes, definitely!</li>\n",

This video on integrals masterfully uses visualizations to motivate basic concepts of calculus in a way that both foreshadows how more advanced topics work and makes the whole idea of an integral intuitive and worthwhile. (And yes, if you’d like to submit a video explanation, go right ahead! But I'm still going to expect it to be rigorous. )</li>\n",
