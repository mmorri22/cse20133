    "## Step 4 - Finding your Container and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will figure out how to find your files that you create in your container on your laptop. The container allows us to have a unified OS environment throughout the class, but you can access the files in the container, just like you would in opening a document or file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why File Hierarchies Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency matters. Like navigating around the house, it’s nice to know where everything is and that items are placed in a logical order (hopefully your kitchenware isn’t found in your bathroom). The same holds true for coding. Knowing where files are, when to use certain code for certain operations, and how to find associated results, data, and figures can not only streamline productivity, but also allow for consistency (even across multiple projects) and shareability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you place your files and how you organize your file structure can be seen as an overall map to your coding projects. As with a map legend, you should establish a set of expectations about where to find parts of the project, and in which order these parts fit (i.e., run) together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do it: For Others\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are working on a class assignment, it is best to work under the mindset that your work will be shared and reproduced by others. For that to happen, you need to organize your code such that newcomers can quickly access key parts of your project without looking through documentation or aimlessly clicking through files. In a way, you want others to <i>thank you</i>. They will hopefully thank you for:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>the time saved in learning your project structure</li>\n",
    "    <li>being able to collaborate more easily with you</li>\n",
    "    <li>quickly learning how your analysis was performed</li>\n",
    "    <li>being able to quickly reproduce your code, which adds confidence to both the collaborator and you.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do it: For you\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever organized your desk to clean up both physical and mental space, then your coding projects deserve the same consideration. The time invested in learning how to organize your code now will help you streamline future projects and add consistency between projects. Even if you are working on a quick homework assignment, think about the hundreds of similar homework assignments for which you have to mock up a folder and then finagle some files (we advise against <a href = \"http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/meche/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/10/file-structure-messydesktop.jpg\">putting everything on your desktop</a>). So whether you’re working on small or big projects, setting a standard structure will add consistency among all of your work and decrease the amount of time it takes to boilerplate your code.\n",
