    "The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883. Numerous myths regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle popped up almost immediately, including a myth about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath containing a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks. The priests would move a disk, and once it was solved, that would be the end of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Only one disk may be moved at a time.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.</li>\n",
    "    <li>No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the legend were true - in actuality, it was actually spread tounge-in-cheek by French mathematician Édouard Luca - then if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves, it would take them 2^64 − 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish."
