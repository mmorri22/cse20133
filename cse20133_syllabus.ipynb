We'll cover the ideas, principles and abstractions that unify computer design â€“ from how your laptop runs multiple programs at the same time, to how companies like Instagram, Airbnb, and Google operate large websites, to how easy it is to exploit security vulnerabilities on badly designed systems. This class is designed for engineers who are interested in learning what programming is, how computer systems work, and why these systems are so critical to modern technology."

At the beginning of the Fall 2023 semester, 55 students were registered, so every student will be asked to present their ideas on two reading questions. For the other two opportunities, students will present their attempt at an in-class problem. Since students may work in pairs, they can present in pairs to earn the remaining points.\n",

You may discuss this code with classmates and help your friends debug, but every piece of code you submit must be written by you and you must not submit wholly identical solutions. A good way to ensure this is for you to type in your solutions individually, even if you are discussing your approach with your friends and you help each other debug.\n",
