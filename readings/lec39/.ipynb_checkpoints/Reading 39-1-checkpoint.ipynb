    "The \"PQC rules\" originated from a dinner I had with <a href = \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-gerstenmaier-3925b210/\">William Gerstenmaier</a> and <a href = \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-morris-15786124/\">Richard Morris</a>, the VPs of Mission Assurance and Production and Launch a SpaceX who have led the development of an impressive software development and testing suite. Software failures are one of the most dominant causes of failures in aerospace mission-critical systems. \n",

    "> This is not the same as number of lines of code. Often MORE lines of code actually makes code simpler, because it is more narrative. There are several examples of code I presented in class that could be done in fewer lines of code, but adding in more steps helped the students <b>understand the procecure</b>, which strengthens their understanding of the programming language.\n",
    "   \n",
    "<b>Unknown unknowns</b>: The worst type of complexity. This occurs when it’s not even clear what you need to know in order to make modifications!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quick Story: Two of your TAs, Tara Flannery and Brooke Mackey, were tasked with updating code on a gyroscopic monitoring system for the Navy. They successfully recommended cleaning up the code base because the systems code would frequently fail on several tests. They even used the PQC rules to prove the previously existing code was inefficient and unsafe, putting sailors at risk. Based on their recommendations, Pacific Northwest Naval Labs adopted the PQC coding standards.\n"
