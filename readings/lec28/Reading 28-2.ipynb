    "\n",
    "STL collections are generic, meaning that they can hold elements of <b>any type</b>, and are implemented using <b>templates</b>. This is extremely handy, because it means that we don't need separate implementations for, say, a vector of integers and a vector of strings."

    "<code><a href = \"\">std::string</a></code> is a vector that is implicitly templated to char, which is akin to the char* array in C. \n",
    "\n",
    "<code><a href = \"https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/forward_list/forward_list/\">std::forward_list</a></code>  is a Singly Linked List.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code><a href = \"https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/\">std::stack</a></code>  is a Stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code><a href = \"https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/\">std::list</a></code> is a Doubly Linked list where we can add and remove elements from the front and back of the linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "<code><a href = \"https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/\">std::queue</a></code> is a Doubly Linked list where we can add to the back and remove from the front back of the linked list only\n",
    "\n",

    "> <b>Note 1:</b> Up to this point in the course, we have focused on the design of the structuring of data in memory. As we progress in this class, we will use the basic data structures to implement more advanced data structures, such as hash tables, graphs, and advanced tree structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>Note 2:</b> We won't be able to cover in detail all the operations that STL collections offer in lectures. The C++ STL is HUGE. The reference material can seem verbose and confusing at first; often, it's easiest to look at the code examples included in the documentation for specific methods to develop an intuition for how you use them. The methods you want often have relatively obvious names (e.g., contains(T element) checks if an std::vector<T> contains element; push_back(T element) on the same vector adds an element to the back),\n"
