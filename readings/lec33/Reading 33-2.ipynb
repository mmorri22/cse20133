    "### Examples of the Steps for Writing a pthread\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 - Write a struct representing the inputs to a function you wish to parallelize \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to take in the pthread_id and two integers, your struct would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    typedef struct thread_func_args{\n",
    "\n",
    "        pthread_t curr_tid;\n",
    "        int input_1;\n",
    "        int input_2;\n",
    "\n",
    "    }thread_func_args;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 - Write the function you wish to implement, except pass a void pointer to the function, and return a void pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function you will call will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    void* thread_func( void* inputs )\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Step 3 - Cast the void* back to a struct pointer inside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the function, you cast inputs to a <code>thread_func_args</code> struct, which allows you to access the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "    thread_func_args* func_inputs = (thread_func_args *)inputs;\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you access the data by de-referencing the inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    std::cout << func_inputs->input_1 << \" \" << func_inputs->input_2 << std::endl;\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Step 4 - You must return a void pointer in the function, so you will write return NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "    return NULL;   \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Step 5 - Create a dynamically allocated struct object in main, and set the values you'd want to input to the function\n",
    "\n",
    "In main, you will set up the struct pointer and set the values\n",
    "\n",
    "    thread_func_args* tid_0_inputs = (thread_func_args*)malloc( sizeof(thread_func_args) );\n",
    "    tid_0_inputs->input_1 = 10;\n",
    "    tid_0_inputs->input_2 = 20;\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6 - Call pthread_create, calling the thread_ID by reference, NULL (we are not adding attributes in this course) and then pass the struct to the pthread by casting to a void pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how to call the <code>pthread_create</code> function:\n",
    "* first argument is to pass the thread ID by reference. Since this is C, we will pass the address of the pthread.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are more inputs, which allow us to create the entire thread. The second input is a data structure of attributes that you can assign to the new thread you are creating. These attributes describe the behavior of that thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could tell the thread to end at a different time than main.\n",
    "But we haven't studied Operating Systems yet, so for now we are just going to pass NULL as the second input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third thread is important. It is a pointer to the function that you want this new thread to execute. When you create a thread, you must give it a piece of code you can execute. For this example, we will call the function thread_func.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    pthread_create( &(tid_0_inputs->curr_tid), NULL, thread_func, (void *)tid_0_inputs );\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7 - Join the pthreads calling pthread_join\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass the thread ID, which in this case is tid_0_inputs->curr_tid, and then NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "    pthread_join( tid_0_inputs->curr_tid,  NULL );\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8 - Free the dynamically allocated structs for the function inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "    free( tid_0_inputs );\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9 - Call pthread_exit( NULL ); as the last thing you do before return main\n",
    "\n",
    "This will force main to wait until all the threads initialized in main are finished, otherwise main will finish too fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pthread_exit( NULL );"
