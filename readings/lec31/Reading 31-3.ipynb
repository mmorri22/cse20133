    "When we allocated a struct on the Data Heap in C, we learned that we could find the address of the struct by using the <code>&variable</code> definition and the <code>%p</code> output specifier. We learned that this address was the <b>base address</b> of the struct.\n",

    "<code>this</code> points to the base address of the class.\n",
