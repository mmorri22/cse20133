    "<b>Complete search</b> is a general method that can be used to solve almost any algorithm problem. The idea is to generate <i>all possible solutions</i> to the problem using <i>brute force</i>, and then select the best solution or count the number of solutions, depending on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Complete search is a good technique if there is enough time to go through all the solutions, because the search is usually easy to implement and it always gives the correct answer. If complete search is too slow, other techniques, such as binary search may be needed.\n",

    "### Our First Example: Generating subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "We first consider the problem of generating all subsets of a set of n elements. For example, the subsets of {0,1,2} are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2} and {0,1,2}\n",

    "An elegant way to go through all subsets of a set is to use recursion. The following function search generates the subsets of the set {0,1,...,n âˆ’ 1}. The function maintains a vector subset that will contain the elements of each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search begins when the function is called with parameter 0 as the start, and 3 as the end in main. The full code that generates this solution may be found at subset.cpp"
