    "### Motivation for Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The world is full of different types of <b>objects</b>. Consider this example: We have a computer, glass of water, desk, and pencils. What happens if I spill the water on the computer? What about the pencils? The computer will react in two completely different ways! \n",
    "\n",
    "In a procedural programming language like C, we would need to write every possible outcome in functions and pass them by reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major goals for <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> is that we <b>define object methods</b> in order to write programs where these objects <b>interact in unanticipated ways</b>, since we models how the objects <i>react</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking this behavior in OOP is known as <b>message passing</b>. For our example above, we would have a method (C++ function) that accounts for the <b>properties</b> of the objects, and <b>emulate</b>s how they would interact with the computer. "
