Although [almost!] unheard of today, this concept isn't really all that new -- there used to not be much choice in years past. Apple computers came with only BASIC and assembly language, and there were books available on assembly language for kids. <b>This is why the old-timers are often viewed as 'wizards': they had to know assembly language proramming.</b>"
