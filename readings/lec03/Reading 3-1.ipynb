    "### Revisiting the Importance of Memory Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For people like us who've always lived with computers, the idea that they didn't exist before the 1930s may seem impossible. Even stranger still may be the notion that computer users in the 1990s and early 2000s had to possess an extensive understanding of hardware in order to efficiently operate a computer. Students who've worked almost exclusively with phone apps and cloud drives might think a professor's insistence on understanding memory and file hierarchies is every bit as antiquated as when my professors insistent that I understand how to use punch cards!\n",
    "\n",
    "But for engineers who will use code in their applications, understanding these concepts is <i>critical</i> to safe, secure, and reliable implementation of their designs. Often, the space for computers in <b>limited</b>, so electrical, aerospace, and mechanical engineers need to understand how changes in memory operations affect their entire system. "

    "This article focuses on the testimony of the NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel to Congress. The director, Paul Hill, said that the “panel has great concern about the end-to-end integrated test capability and plans, especially for flight software.” They felt NASA's engineers and contractors were not taking the lessons from a nearly-catastrophic software error in <a href = \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/07/boeing-starliner-software-problems/\">Boeing's Starliner spacecraft</a>, where a pair of software errors that prevented it from docking with the International Space Station as planned and forced controllers to cut the mission short in 2020.\n",

    "Paul Hill told me that \"students think of code as this amorphous blob that just floats around the systems as magically does everything that they need it to do. They need to understand that code is <i>physical</i>, just like a moment arm or a transistor, and needs to be treated like any other physical part of the system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Doug Loverro said \"We don’t know how many software errors we have — if we have just two or many hundreds. <u>The bottom line is that industry is very bad at doing software</u>. Students who are understand the concepts you are teaching will be <i>an invaluable asset to the United States and to NASA</i>.\""
