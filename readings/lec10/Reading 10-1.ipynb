    "### A Metaphor for Types of Computer Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Lecture 0 that computing is the <i>mechanization of thought</i>. If you understand how humans think, you will be able to get a much stronger grasp on how pointers work, because pointers were designed to <i>replicate the process of human thought</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>pointer</b> is a data element that represents a location in memory. When we print memory locations in the UNIX, the result will be presented in <i>hexadecimal</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three types of memory in the human brain form the <b>Declarative Pathway</b>, where information in your short-term working memory is transferred to the <b>neocortex</b> (long-term memory) via the <b>hippocampus</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a computer, the three types of memory form the Computer Architecture,  where information in the <b>registers</b> is transferred to the <b>dynamic memory</b> (long-term memory) via the <b>static memory</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Think of the Hippocampus as a \"Know-It-All\". While the hippocampus is quick and attentive, and excellent at cramming, the knowledge is superficial and does not last long.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The long-term memory is called the \"Neocortex\". The Neocortex is scatterbrained, but is a deep thinker. When you put ideas together in your mind, this is performed in the Neocortex.</li>\n",

    "### The Parable of the Choir\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to think of a human's memory like a choir, where the Hippocampus and Neocortex are \"conducted\" by the short term working memory. Working memory can either hold a piece of information or point to where information is located.\n",
    " \n",
    "Think of pointers as the conductors of a program. In order to access data, we need to know where that information is located in the computer! \n",

    "The Hippocampus cannot do two things at once, so we regulate how they communicate with a set of step, just like an assembly line!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tying the metaphor together\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use the analogy between computing memory and the way our brain remembers and processes information. To review, that analogy was:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Registers</b>, like our working memory, are limited, fast, and control how we process information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Instruction Stack</b>, like the Hippocampus, is slightly slower, and \"crams and forgets\" information.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Data Memory</b>, like the Neocortex, is the slowest, but can be used to structure and store long-term information and data.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So why is knowing memory locations in a computer important?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Registers are <b>limited</b>, and we must use them strategically and effectively\n",
    "    <li>The Instruction Stack is <b>static</b> – the data and information must be known at compile time, just like your brain has to keep track of the current tasks.\n",
    "    <li>Heap is <b>dynamic</b> – Can reallocate whenever we want, just like we can train our brain to remember information</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pointers make the operation run\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>They allow you to refer to large data structures in a <b>compact</b> way</li>\n",
    "    <li>They facilitate <b>sharing</b> between different parts of programs</li>\n",
    "    <li>They make it possible to get new memory dynamically <b>as your program is running</b></li>\n",
    "    <li>They make it easy to <b>represent relationships</b> among data items.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we already know!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already learned about an address within a machine\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Use <code>%p</code> as the output specifier for a memory address</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use <code>&</code> to obtain the address of a memory location</li>\n",
    "    <li>Most of the memory we have worked with so far starts with <code>0x7ff...</code></li>\n",
    "    <li>... but not all of it!</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
