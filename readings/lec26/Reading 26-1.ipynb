    "The only place where a computer can store information is memory. It's up to the systems software and the programs that the computer runs to decide what these bytes actually mean. They could be program code, data (integers, strings, images, etc.), or \"meta-data\" used to build more complex data structures from simple memory boxes. Understanding how complex programs boil down to bytes will help you debug your program, and will make you appreciate why they behave the way they do."
